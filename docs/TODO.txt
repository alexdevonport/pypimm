- Make use of the standard library configparse module

PyPIMM does the following tasks:
    - read multiple types of data from a single text file
    - process sets of data, which are interpreted as signals
    - create a set of best-fit models

So it should be organized into modules, so that each module is focused on solving one of those tasks.
